# Vibrating string

The task is to determine the shape of a homogeneous vibrating string fixed at both ends. Let us assume that the string has a length $l > 0$ and vibrates in the transverse plane. For the entire theory and the development of the task, please refer to the [theory.pdf](https://github.com/szabo-krisztian/VibratingString/tree/master/theory.pdf) file in the repository. There you can also find the brief history of the problem.
